# Rank-AVL-Tree-Tester
 * A Rank\AVL Tree Tester that checks and prints your tree to test your Implementation!
 * Credits to galwert 
 * Please Read the README File to run this test
 *
 * This file has a main in it, so make sure it is the only one
 * Instructions:
 * To run on Linux server:
 * 1.Move the Required files for your Tree to this Repositoy
 * 2.Change file/functions names to fit this tester (RankTree.h)
 * 3.Run this command on Linux: chmod +x run_test.sh
 * 4.Run this command on Linux: ./run_test.sh
 *
 *
 * To run on Windows with Clion:
 * 1.Include your files that implements your tree
 * 2.This file has a main in it, so make sure it is the only one
 * 3.Add this file and your files to CMakeList.c
 * 4.Run and test your tree
 *
 * Additional Important Notes:
 * You may add any additional functions you need.
 * Remove Lines 56-60 if u are testing only an AVL Tree
 * Remove lines 66-84 if your Node class doesn't use a parent pointer
 * Prints the tree after every insertion and deletion.
 * Assert func is used to check the Height, Balance Factor, Pointers and the tree being Binary Search Tree.
 * You can comment lines 176-177,183-184 to specify the problem if happens in your code.
 * I would suggest first beginning with a simple tree and then moving on to a more complex one.
 * To stress test your code, create 100 vector with the size of 1000(can do without printing for faster results)
