# Rank-AVL-Tree-Tester
 * A Rank/AVL Tree Tester to test your tree implementation
 *
 * Replace all the red errors with your own Tree code.
 * You may add any additional functions you need.
 * Prints the tree after every insertion and deletion.
 * Assert func is used to check the Height, Balance Factor, Pointers and the tree being Binary Search Tree.
 * You can comment lines 169-170,175-176 to specify the problem if happens in your code.
 * I would suggest first beginning with a simple tree and then moving on to a more complex one.
 * To stress test your code, create 100 vector with the size of 1000.
 * G O O D  L U C K !
